# BH (Blizzhackers)
An archive repository for McGod's original BH dating back to 2011. The code was cloned from the Assembla repository.

Note that this README file was not originally a part of the repository, but exists to explain the purpose of this repository.

## Archive
This repository is strictly an archive for preservation purposes. The goal for this project is to make a best-effort attempt at replicating the original Assembla repository in this GitHub repository.

No changes to the source code will be accepted, and interaction with the repository is locked down. There are forks of the original 2011 code that are actively maintained, that may be more than willing to accept changes. An alternative is to fork this repository and make changes from that fork. See [BH2011x](https://github.com/SlashDiablo-II/BH2011x) for a project that aims to maintain the functionality of the original 2011 build, but with bugfixes and modern tools.

## Compiling
This project requires Visual Studio 2010 or newer to open the project and compile. No guarantees or help will be provided.

## Legal
BH has no license attached to it. The copyright is therefore "All rights reserved." and all the original authors assume copyright ownership for their individual commits.
